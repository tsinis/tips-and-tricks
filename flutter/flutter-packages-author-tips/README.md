# Flutter Packages Author Tips

## Description

Flutter packages authors, this one is for you. If you haven't already done so (as of January 2023), make sure to include screenshots in your packages, preferably in the WEBP format to have control over the conversion result. And for those of you hosting your packages on GitHub (which is probably 99% of you :D), don't forget that GitHub Pages allows you to host your pages for open-source repos for free. You can showcase your packages there directly on a separate branch (e.g., gh-pages) using a URL like "your github io/your package repo name"
